# AUTOMTED-ATTENDANCE-SYSTEM
## PROBLEM STATEMENT

In India, the reopening of educational institutes is delayed due to the fear that students may not follow basic corona precautionary norms. So we aim to create an AI-based system to check whether students are following all rules or not and scan the body temperature, for precautionary measures. We aim to create an automated attendance system that will promote contactless and hassle-free attendance. Our system would reduce the fear of reopening educational institutions by making monitoring of students easy and would make the students feel safer given the fact that they are being monitored with all the necessary precautions.

## SOLUTION 

We eliminated the above challenges by demonstrating the use of face recognition in the attendance management system. The system takes attendance by using a camera to capture an image of the student, detect the face, and confirm with the faces in the database. On identification of a registered student face, the studentâ€™s attendance will be marked present. Attendance system, mask detection, and body temperature monitoring with all these features combined, our framework would be the first of its kind product available to date. The system is designed to be cost-effective when compared to all these features being used individually.
